## 🔐 VoIP Flood Attack Detection

This repository contains the implementation and research work carried out during my Summer Internship at IIT-BHU, focused on VoIP (Voice over IP) Flood Attack Detection using Explainable Machine Learning and Self-Supervised Techniques.

## 📌 Project Highlights
- Developed an intrusion detection system for **VoIP Flood Attacks** (REGISTER and RTP Flood).
- Used **CatBoost**, **EBM**, and **Self-Supervised Tabular Models** for accurate detection.
- Achieved over **99.5% F1-Score** on real-world VoIP datasets.
- Extracted protocol-level features from SIP/RTP traffic using Wireshark captures.
- Combined **supervised + unsupervised models** (HDBSCAN, Isolation Forest) for zero-day attack detection.
